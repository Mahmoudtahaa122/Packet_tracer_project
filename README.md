# üè¢ Company Network Simulation Using Cisco Packet Tracer

## Overview

This project is a simulation of a company's network infrastructure created using Cisco Packet Tracer. The network includes different departments like IT, HR, Sales, and Accounting, each with its own VLAN and network configuration. The project was designed to enhance understanding of network setup, VLANs, DHCP, OSPF routing, and subnetting.

## Network Features

- **VLAN Segmentation**: Each department (IT, HR, Sales, Accounting) has its own VLAN for isolated network traffic.
- **VLSM Subnetting**: Efficient use of IP addresses through Variable Length Subnet Masking.
- **DHCP Configuration**: Dynamic IP address assignment for devices to simplify network management.
- **OSPF Protocol**: Implemented Open Shortest Path First protocol for efficient routing.
- **Server Setup**: Includes a server to simulate and test network services.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Cisco Packet Tracer**: Make sure you have Cisco Packet Tracer installed on your system. You can download it from the [Cisco NetAcad website](https://www.netacad.com/courses/packet-tracer).

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/company-network-simulation.git
   cd company-network-simulation
   ```

2. **Open the Project**:
   - Launch Cisco Packet Tracer.
   - Open the `.pkt` file located in the project directory.

### Usage

- Explore the network topology.
- Test connectivity between different VLANs.
- Check the DHCP configuration and IP address allocation.
- Experiment with OSPF routing.
